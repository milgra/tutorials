Full stack web develoment with clojure github

Simply put, full stack web development is generating web pages for the user's browser based on the user's requests. This can happen in the browser at the client side and on the web server machine at the server side, usually both side is involved.

A web server is a program that listens for connections from browsers, and based on the route and the parameters of the request it passes back data. This data can be a web page written in HTML or any kind of data that the client side code will insert into the existing client side HTML page.

https://example.com/users/user?name=milan&hair=brown
server address : [https://example.com] 
route : [/users/user?name=milan&hair=brown]
